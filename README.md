# 2D Tower Defense Game

## Overview
This is a simple 2D Tower Defense game built using Unity. The primary goal of this project is to learn and practice C#, data structures, algorithms, and Unity game development.

## Features
- Basic tower placement and enemy pathfinding
- Multiple enemy waves with increasing difficulty
- Different types of towers with unique abilities
- Simple UI for health, money, and wave progression
- Basic game loop with win/lose conditions

## Technologies Used
- Unity (latest version)
- C# for scripting
- Unity's built-in physics and pathfinding

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Press `Play` in the Unity Editor to start the game.

## How to Play
1. Place towers on the map to stop enemy waves.
2. Each enemy that reaches the end will result in a game over.
3. Earn money by defeating enemies and use it to upgrade towers or build more towers.
4. Survive endless waves (currently, there is no ending).

## Future Improvements
- More tower and enemy types
- Better animations and sound effects
- Improved UI/UX
- Boss enemies and an eventual game ending
- Better game balancing for fair and engaging difficulty
- Performance optimization for smoother gameplay
- Cleaner and more maintainable code
